refactor: simplify vacancy processing flow with priority queues

- Add QUEUED status for vacancies in processing queue
- Create VacancyProcessingQueueService for high-priority vacancy analysis
- Create SkillExtractionQueueService for low-priority skill extraction
- Rewrite flow: analysis -> Telegram -> skill extraction queue (no cover letter generation)
- Remove cover letter generation (CoverLetterQueueService, CoverLetterGenerationService)
- Optimize VacancyDto: add getExperienceYearsString() for fast filtering
- Update VacancyFetchService: vacancies saved with QUEUED status and added to queue
- Update VacancyAnalysisService: remove cover letter generation and skill extraction
- Update VacancyNotificationService: remove cover letter from Telegram message
- Update VacancySchedulerService: add scheduled processing of QUEUED vacancies
- Mark cover letter related fields in VacancyAnalysis as @Deprecated

Benefits:
- Faster: removed slow cover letter generation
- Priorities: analysis first, then skill extraction
- Simpler: fewer components, clearer logic
- Non-blocking: coroutine-based processing, Telegram commands work
